    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Flan is a custard dessert known for its milky, sweet taste and the spongey, gelatin-like texture. It is made with milk, eggs, and a whole lot of sugar.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Flan:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pieces egg</li>
      <li>1/2 ounce unflavored gelatin powder (uncolored)</li>
      <li>7.6 ounces all-purpose cream</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup evaporated milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Caramel:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons water</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons granulated white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the caramel by combining sugar and water in a saucepan. Apply heat. Continue cooking while stirring until the mixture thickens and the color turns medium brown. This is now the caramel.</li>
      <li>Pour the caramel into separate molds. (Note: you may use glass, metal, or ceramic baking pans as molds for the flan. Using ramekins is also a good idea.) Tilt the mold to spread caramel evenly. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Start making the flan by cracking the eggs into the bowl. Beat using a wire whisk. Gradually add sugar. Continue beating until mixture gets well blended. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Microwave 1/4 cup the water for 35 seconds. Combine powdered gelatin and water. Mix well by stirring. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Pour milk into a pan. Apply heat until it goes into a simmer. (Note: do not apply too much heat. We want the milk to only be below boiling point).</li>
      <li>Scoop around 5 to 6 tablespoons of warm milk (1 tablespoon at a time) into the bowl with sugar and eggs. Continue to stir the mixture. (Note: This process is also known as tempering. Two ingredients with different temperatures are gradually combined in order to slowly rise to the same temp.)</li>
      <li>Pour the mixture from the bowl into the pan. Continue stirring until well blended.</li>
      <li>Gradually add gelatin mixture while stirring. Continue cooking in low heat for 1 minute. Turn off heat.</li>
      <li>Transfer mixture back to the bowl. Add all-purpose cream and vanilla extract. Stir until well blended. Remove bubbles by skimming.</li>
      <li>Pour the flan mixture into the molds. Cover each mold with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
      <li>Serve for dessert. Share and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
